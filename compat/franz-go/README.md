# franz-go compatibility suite

Runs the [franz-go](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go) `pkg/kgo`
integration test suite against tansu, as a client-compatibility check.
franz-go is the most widely used pure-Go Kafka client and exercises
newer protocol surface than librdkafka (flexible versions throughout,
KIP-345 static membership, KIP-848 next-gen groups, KIP-932 share
groups), so it complements the librdkafka suite.

## Running

```shell
just compat-franz-go
```

This builds tansu (`dynostore` feature), starts a `memory://` broker
advertising `tcp://127.0.0.1:9092`, then runs `run.sh`, which:

1. clones franz-go at the tag pinned in `run.sh` (`FRANZ_GO_VERSION`)
   into `target/compat/franz-go` (a Go toolchain is the only build
   requirement),
2. runs the tests listed in `tests.allow` in a single `go test`
   invocation against the broker (`BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` to override),
   with `KGO_TEST_RF=1` (tansu is single-node) and
   `KGO_TEST_RECORDS=10000` to keep the ETL-style tests quick.

To run against an already-running broker, call `./run.sh` directly.

To investigate a single test:

```shell
cd target/compat/franz-go/pkg/kgo
KGO_TEST_RF=1 KGO_LOG_LEVEL=debug \
    go test -count=1 -timeout 120s -v -run '^TestAddRemovePartitions$' .
```

## The allowlist

`tests.allow` lists tests known to pass. When broker compatibility
improves, re-sweep the excluded tests and grow the allowlist.
`FINDINGS.md` records the gaps behind the tests that are excluded.

Some allowlisted tests self-skip against tansu: the SCRAM tests
(no `KGO_TEST_SCRAM` configured) and the share-group / KIP-848 tests
(tansu does not advertise ShareFetch v2 or ConsumerGroupHeartbeat v1).
They are kept in the allowlist so they light up automatically when the
broker grows support.
